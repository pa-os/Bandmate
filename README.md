# Bandmate

I am a member of a band and it's really annoying to use spreadsheets for gig organization. I am also a Frontend Software Engineer looking for a project to persue in my free time that helps me learn new skills. So I combined the two situations in an effort to hone my skills and maybe make the organization of my band easier for everyone involved.

## Prerequisites

1. The project uses **Prettier** and **ESlint**. Install the respective plugins on your machine and make sure they work properly.
2. Node.js >=v20

## Get Started

1. `git clone` the project to your machine
1. install dependencies: `npm i`
1. run the app in development mode: `npm run dev`

## Setup

### Techstack

- Typescript
- React
- MSW + mswjs/data
- Material UI (Free Tier)
- React-Router
- React-Hook-Form-MUI
- SWR

### Tooling

- Vite

## Troubleshooting
